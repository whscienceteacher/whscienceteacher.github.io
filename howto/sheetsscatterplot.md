# How to make a scatter graph in Google Sheets
## Selecting Data
Scatter graphs have numerical data for both the x and y axes. To make a scatter graph you need to select two columns of data. There are two ways to select multiple columns in Sheets. 
If the data are next two each other you can click and drag from the middel of a cell down and over.

If the data are separated, you can select the first column then hold the Ctrl key as you select the second column.

The new chart might already be a scatter plot but Google Sheets is unreliable at guessing chart type. You can always change the chart type using the `Chart Type` dropdown menu at the top of the `Setup` tab of the `Chart Editor` on the right side while editing the chart. If you don't see the Chart Editor on the right try double clicking on the chart.
