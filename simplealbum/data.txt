||Title=Pride Hunting
|Text=There was a pride of lions consisting of six females and one male sitting in the sun in an area of short grass. A buffalo came along grazing. It saw the lions but continued moving slowly and grazing.

|Text=As it got closer, the lions got up one-by-one and moved towards it a slow half crouch. Every time the buffalo looked up, the lions froze, thought one always kept moving.

|Text=They were in plain sight of the buffalo and eventually the buffalo was spooked and ran away. The lions didnâ€™t follow.

||Title=Single Lioness
|Text=There was also a solitary lioness walking over the hills apparently looking for a meal in the same area. She passed by a herd of impalas, then sat for a time on the side of the hill looking around.

Eventually she took off again followed by a jackal. The grass was too tall to get a good picture of them leaving.

||Title=Prides Resting
|Text=Lions appear to spend a huge part of the day resting. Most of the time when we saw lions, the adults were lying down. The cubs often played a little bit while one or two of the adults lazily watched.

|Text=These lions think they are leopards and were lying in the trees.
Their family was nearby. Eventually they jumped down to round up the cubs.

|Text=Maybe they like to lay in the tree because it gave them a good view.
We often saw lion on high places, be it a cliff or just a termite mound.
