[You've got some good stuff! One that I liked a lot more than you might expect is the Motion Yes No sim.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/i9qvly/high_school_physics_resource_sharing/g1hs7jt/?context=3)

[I haven’t spent a ton of time looking through all your apps, but the ones I’ve looked at appear to be very easy for me to drop into existing lessons. I hate finding a cool simulation or app but realizing i need to change my existing lessons to make it fit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/i97fhl/i_cleaned_up_some_more_science_apps_ive_used_in/g1fvrwy/?context=3)

[I love how simple and straightforward these are. Your minimalist approach allows me to easily adapt them to my classes without having to teach my content in a different way to fit the simulation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/i97fhl/i_cleaned_up_some_more_science_apps_ive_used_in/g1foeih/?context=3)

[THANK YOU WILD HAIRED SCIENCE TEACHER!!!!! If I could give you an award, I would! This is all so incredible! You are leading the way to the future of learning, especially in these difficult times of remote learning! I can’t thank you enough on behalf of all teachers and students! I will definitely be using all of these apps this year!](https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/i931y7/more_science_apps_i_made_for_everyone_to_use_for/g1f7jzf/?context=3)

[These are AWESOME! Thank you for sharing because I can see ways of integrating them into my classes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/i97fhl/i_cleaned_up_some_more_science_apps_ive_used_in/g1dz74m/?context=3)

[Incredible stuff! The ants measurement one is brilliant. Well, they’re all brilliant. Thank you for sharing!](https://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/i51m80/with_so_many_classes_being_remote_i_wanted_to_do/g0ooexy/?context=3)

[Oh my goodness, thank you so much!!! These will be great since hands off labs are a no go for students this year.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/i4wwky/ive_been_making_physics_apps_for_my_own_classroom/g0mv1je/?context=3)

[From one wild haired science teacher to another, thank you! Will likely be sharing these with my department](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/i4wwky/ive_been_making_physics_apps_for_my_own_classroom/g0ldhs4/?context=3)

[These are amazing ! I wish we had these in school. Would've made science a lot more fun.](https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/im3iey/ive_been_making_apps_for_my_own_class_for_years/g3ywi40/)

[Alright who has the best teacher award? I need to give it to this teacher. What did he do? He created apps that helps students with science! You found it? Good time for your award.](https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/im3iey/ive_been_making_apps_for_my_own_class_for_years/g3yop6d/)

[As a student who has learned almost all of these topics from a textbook, your apps would have been GREATLY appreciated. Extremely relevant and useful!](https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/im3iey/ive_been_making_apps_for_my_own_class_for_years/g3yxzqj/)

[Holy crap, these are awesome. So many of the online Sims I've found try to do too much, and end up being bloated and confusing. I love that these are designed to show one thing very effectively. I'll definitely be using these this year. Thank you!](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/1my691q/new_bio_chem_and_physics_simulations_and_some/naapf3w/)
