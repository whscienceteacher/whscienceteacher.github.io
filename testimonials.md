[You've got some good stuff! One that I liked a lot more than you might expect is the Motion Yes No sim.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/i9qvly/high_school_physics_resource_sharing/g1hs7jt/?context=3)

[I haven’t spent a ton of time looking through all your apps, but the ones I’ve looked at appear to be very easy for me to drop into existing lessons. I hate finding a cool simulation or app but realizing i need to change my existing lessons to make it fit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/i97fhl/i_cleaned_up_some_more_science_apps_ive_used_in/g1fvrwy/?context=3)

[I love how simple and straightforward these are. Your minimalist approach allows me to easily adapt them to my classes without having to teach my content in a different way to fit the simulation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceTeachers/comments/i97fhl/i_cleaned_up_some_more_science_apps_ive_used_in/g1foeih/?context=3)

[THANK YOU WILD HAIRED SCIENCE TEACHER!!!!! If I could give you an award, I would! This is all so incredible! You are leading the way to the future of learning, especially in these difficult times of remote learning! I can’t thank you enough on behalf of all teachers and students! I will definitely be using all of these apps this year!](https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/i931y7/more_science_apps_i_made_for_everyone_to_use_for/g1f7jzf/?context=3)
