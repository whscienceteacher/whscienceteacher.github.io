## Wave Measurement Badges
[Back to Unit Home Page](./index.md)

Waves can be described in different ways. To be ready for the rest of the unit, you need to master the measurement of both longitudinal and transverse waves.

Everyone must earn at least a silver badge, but you can get up to a platinum badge if you work hard enough.
