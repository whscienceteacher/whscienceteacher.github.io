## Lesson 1 - How to Measure Waves Part 1 - Transverse waves
[Back to Unit Home Page](./index.md)

All waves are a pattern of vibrations. In transverse waves, the vibration is at a right angle to the direction the wave moves. In the example below, the wave moves to the right, and the particles move up and down.

Waves can be described using several quantities:

- Period - The time it takes for a dot to go through a whole cycle. [How-to video](./howtomeasureperiod.mp4)
- Amplitude - The distance from the middle each dot moves. [How-to video](./howtomeasureamplitude.mp4)
- Wavelength - The distance from one wave to the next. [How-to video](./howtomeasurewavelength.mp4)

Those definitions are **not** that helpful. You probably want to watch the videos. The videos use the Simple Wave Measurement simulation from above so you can follow along.

Once you understand how to meausure Period, Amplitude, and Wavelength, you can practice using the full [Wave Measurement Simulation](https://whscience.org/wavemeasure/measure/).

Assignment for the day: Take a screenshot of 10 in a row for the [Bronze Badge](./badges.md).
