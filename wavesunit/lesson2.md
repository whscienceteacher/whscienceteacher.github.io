## Lesson 2 - How to Measure Waves Part 2 - Longitudinal Waves
[Back to Unit Home Page](./index.md)

All waves are a pattern of vibrations. In longitudinal waves, the vibration is in the same direction that the wave moves. In the example below, the wave moves to the right, and the particles move left and right.

Measurement of the wave quantities is similar to with [transverse waves](./lesson1.md), but it can be a little different. The videos below can help.
