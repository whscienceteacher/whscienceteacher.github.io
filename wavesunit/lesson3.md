## Lesson 3 â€“ Applying to Music
[Back to Unit Home Page](./index.md)

Now that you know how to measure waves, you can apply your skills to music. 

The link below is a digital piano that allows you to see longitudinal sound waves.

### Assignment for the day:

Use the simulation to explain how one musical note is different from another. Take specific measurements to support your observations. 

You need to be able to measure longitudinal waves. You can go back to [lesson 2](./lesson2.md) for help or watch the videos.
