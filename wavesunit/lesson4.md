## Lesson 4 â€“ Complex Music
[Back to Unit Home Page](./index.md)

Now that you know how different musical notes are different from each other, you can apply that to complex music. Most forms of music include multiple notes at the same time.

The simulated piano below allows you to play multiple notes at the same time.

If you have a touch device, you can press multiple keys at once. If you are using a mouse, you can drag the blue dot to a key and when you click on another the note with the blue dot will play with it.

### Assignment for the day:

Some combinations of musical notes sound good together and some seem to clash. 

Play each note on the combination along with key 1, C. For example, play key 1 and 2 together, 1 and 3 together, 1 and 4 together, etc.

Choose your two favorite combinations that you sound *best* together. Choose the two combinations that you think sound *worst* together. Use your measurements from [Lesson 3](./lesson3.md) to compare their wavelengths.
